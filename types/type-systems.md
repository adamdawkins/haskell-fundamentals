Type Systems
============

Static Types
------------
* `int x = "hello";` is invalid
* C, C++, Java, etc.

+ More errors caught at compile-time:
- Write lots of types
- Hard to re-use code

Dynamic Types
-------------
* `var x = "hello';`
* JavaScript, Ruby, Python &c.

+ Never write a type
+ Easy to repeat code
- More run time errors

Haskell's Type System
=====================

Statically typed:
* lots of compile-time erros
* few run-time errors

Types are inferred:
* Don't have to write out explicit types
* Explicit types communicate with people, not the compiler
